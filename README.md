A starter kit for Ethereum Smart Contracts development

> :warning: **NOTE**: This repository is no longer updated. Please use [Solidity Toolkit](https://github.com/noncept/solidity-toolkit).


## Development

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage (using Truffle)

Open the Truffle console

```bash
npm run truffle:console
```

### Compile

```bash
npm run truffle:compile
```

### Test

```bash
npm run truffle:test
```

## Usage (using Hardhat)

Open the Hardhat console

```bash
npm run hardhat:console
```

### Compile

```bash
npm run hardhat:compile
```

### Test

```bash
npm run hardhat:test
```

### Code Coverage

```bash
npm run hardhat:coverage
```

## Linter

Use Solhint

```bash
npm run lint:sol
```

Use ESLint

```bash
npm run lint:js
```

Use ESLint and fix

```bash
npm run lint:fix
```

## Use web3 console in your browser (i.e. to use MetaMask)

By default it takes contracts compiled with Truffle.

To use Hardhat compiled contracts change `./build/contracts` with `./artifacts` in `bs-config.json`

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Flattener

This allow to flatten the code into a single file

Edit `scripts/flat.sh` to add your contracts

```bash
npm run flat
```

## Analysis

Note: it is better to analyze the flattened code to have a bigger overview on the entire codebase. So run the flattener first.

### Describe

The `describe` command shows a summary of the contracts and methods in the files provided

```bash
surya describe dist/SampleContract.dist.sol
```

### Dependencies

The `dependencies` command outputs the c3-linearization of a given contract's inheirtance graph. Contracts will be listed starting with most-derived, ie. if the same function is defined in more than one contract, the solidity compiler will use the definition in whichever contract is listed first.

```bash
surya dependencies SampleContract dist/SampleContract.dist.sol
```
### Generate Report

Edit `scripts/analyze.sh` to add your contracts

```bash
npm run analyze
```

The `inheritance` command outputs a DOT-formatted graph of the inheritance tree.

The `graph` command outputs a DOT-formatted graph of the control flow.

The `mdreport` command creates a markdown description report with tables comprising information about the system's files, contracts and their functions.

The `sol2uml` generates UML class diagram from Solidity contracts.
